Sample Code &amp; Pipeline Templates for Spinnaker Summit 2018

## jenkins ##
---
This directory contains sample declarative pipelines used for executing builds as part of a CICD process.

## spinnaker ##
---
This directory contains sample `pipeline templates` and `pipeline configs`.

By sharing `pipeline templates`, we reduce the amount of boilerplate necessary to create new Spinnaker Pipelines.

Most new deployments just require a new `pipeline config`.
